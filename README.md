## Installation

You can install `react-google-place-suggest` via npm:

```

## Setup

### Get a Google Places API Key

To use this component, you'll need a [Google Places API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started). Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create or select a project.
3. Enable the "Places API" for your project.
4. Generate an API key under "Credentials."

### Set Up CORS (Client-Side Only)

If you're using this component on the client side, Google Places API may block requests due to CORS restrictions. It's recommended to use a proxy server to handle the requests if you're running into CORS issues. Alternatively, if you're able to, use the component server-side to bypass CORS restrictions.

## Usage

Here's how to use the component in your React app:

### Basic Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import GoogleAutocomplete from 'react-google-place-suggest';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Google Places Autocomplete</h1>
      <GoogleAutocomplete apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google Places API key.
